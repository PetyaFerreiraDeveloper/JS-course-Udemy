# JS-project
Build a weather app. Fetching data in real time by connecting to an API. Returning the current weather forecast, after user has enetered a name of a city.
If you want to make the project work, you will need to get your own API key from this web site: https://openweathermap.org/api and declare your own apiKey variable in the app.
